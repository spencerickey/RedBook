Rickey Red Book ~ Artificial Intelligence Final Project Spring 2021
## Purpose
I wrote this simple python program to predict the value of a Voltswagen Passat based on this [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lepchenkov/usedcarscatalog) dataset.<br>
The assignment for the final project was to pick a dataset and implement one of the machine learning algorithms we had learned about in the class and use the data in a practical way. <br>
I like analyze the value of used cars, so I chose the Used Car dataset. It was a useful collection of data even though it was from Belarus. 
I originally developed the program in PyCharm, but then I migrated it to VS Code.
