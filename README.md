Rickey Red Book ~ Artificial Intelligence Final Project Spring 2021
## Purpose
I wrote this simple python program to predict the value of a Voltswagen Passat based on [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lepchenkov/usedcarscatalog) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).<br>
The assignment for the final project was to pick a dataset and implement one of the machine learning algorithms we had learned about on the data. We also use the algorithm on the data in some sort of practical way with a real world solution. <br><br>
I like thinking and talking about used cars, and I chose a dataset to match. I wanted it to be a project I was interested in.<br>
It was a useful collection of data even though it was outdated and from Belarus. <br>
Of all the machine learning algorithms we learned in the class, the decision tree classifier caught my attention. I found an implementation through skikit learn that fit my needs very nicely.<br>
I originally developed the program in PyCharm, but then I migrated it to VS Code. For a few weeks back in April, 2021, I played around with the idea of making a website to display the prediction part of the program, but then I realized it wouldn't work with the framework I was looking at. I didn't have enough time to create a more complicated web app by that point so I left it as a terminal program.
